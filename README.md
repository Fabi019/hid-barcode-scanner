  <h1>HID Barcode Scanner</h1>
</div>


Android app for scanning barcodes with the phone camera and sending them to a PC via bluetooth. No
special software is required on the PC as this app uses the BluetoothHID API available on devices
running Android 9 or greater.

## Features

- Supports a wide range of Linear and 2D-Codes thanks to
  the [zxing-cpp](https://github.com/zxing-cpp/zxing-cpp) library
- Doesn't require any internet connection
- History feature that allows exporting the session as text, JSON or CSV
- Multiple different keyboard layouts to choose from
- Large amount of customization for different use-cases
    - Extra keys like \n or \t
    - Template engine to send additional special keys including modifier combinations
    - Regex filtering of codes with support for capture group extraction
    - JavaScript engine to implement custom logic based on the value and type
    - Auto connect with last device
    - Auto send on detection
    - And much more

## Screenshots

Device list and Scanner screen. If you don't want to connect with any device now and just want to
try out the scanner, pressing the 'Skip'-Button at the bottom of the paired devices will bring you
directly to the scanner.

Otherwise the app tries to connect with the selected device and automatically sends you to the
scanner once connected.

### Download as APK

You can either download the latest stable version from
the [Releases](https://github.com/Fabi019/hid-barcode-scanner/releases) tab or directly from
the [CI](https://github.com/Fabi019/hid-barcode-scanner/actions/workflows/test.yml) using the links
below. Please note that the CI version might be unstable and that the builds are not signed (debug
builds), thus requiring you to install them on your phone using *ADB*. The download links below
are using *nightly.link* to provide the files because GitHub doesn't allow to download files from

## Troubleshooting

If you are unable to connect with a device you can try either of the steps below depending on how
the app behaves.
If these don't help, feel free to open a new issue and describe your problem in detail.

### Connection dialog visible, but no connection possible

This is most likely caused because the phone was paired with the PC previously and now doesn't
accept a new type of connection request.

***Solution:***

1. Make sure to first unpair the PC on the phone either from within the app or from the system
   Bluetooth settings
2. Remove the phone from the PC device list.
   On Windows you can either do this through the device manager (look under the Bluetooth category)
   and choose *Uninstall Device* or using the device list in the settings app.
3. In the app now search for new devices and click on the target PC (This step could be important so
   that the phone can tell the PC the new device type)
4. A pairing request should show up and you may need to confirm a pin on both sides
5. After that the connection should be successfully established

### Nothing happens when clicking on a device

If there is not even a connection dialog when clicking on a device. This means that the registered
Bluetooth proxy was interrupted. Normally it should be connected again right away but in some cases
this might not happen.

***Solution:***

Restart the app. When launching again, there should be a small message at the bottom of the screen
that says the Bluetooth proxy was successfully connected. Otherwise you may have to restart your
device. This could also mean that your device does not support the Bluetooth HID profile. To test
this, search for the app "Bluetooth HID Profile Tester" in the PlayStore and see what the result is.
If the test is not successful, unfortunately your device is not supported.

### Adding new keyboard layout

When the app sends a code to the connected device it doesn't send characters directly.
Instead the app works by sending raw HID-codes to the connected device (The same way a USB-keyboard
behaves).
It is then up to the connected device to interpret this HID-code depending on the layout that is
currently selected in the OS.
This means, that if a scanned barcode contains the character 'Z', the app needs to know the keyboard
layout that the host PC expects (QWERTZ/QWERTY) to send the right HID-code that result in that
character.
To solve this the layout in the app must match the selected layout in the PC.

The app already implements a basic set of keyboard layouts to choose from.
If you want to add a new keyboard layout the following steps might help you:

1. The first step is to create the actual keyboard layout file, for this a great guide already
   exists in the layout for the [polish keyboard](app/src/main/assets/keymaps/pl.layout).
   The layout file always consists of a list of characters with the hid code and modifier.
2. Add the name of the layout to the `<string-array name="keyboard_layout_values">` for every
   available language under `app/src/main/res/values-*/strings.xml`
3. Extend the switch case
   in [BluetoothController.kt#sendString](app/src/main/java/dev/fabik/bluetoothhid/bt/BluetoothController.kt#L285).
   The number is the index of the entry in the `keyboard_layout_values` and the value is the name of
   the layout file without extension (usually two letters)

## Connection Modes

The app supports two connection modes: **HID** (default) and **RFCOMM** (Serial Port Profile). While HID mode works immediately by emulating a keyboard, RFCOMM mode requires additional setup and may need software on your PC to receive data.

### When to use RFCOMM mode

- **Non-intrusive operation:** RFCOMM sends data invisibly in the background without interfering with the user's current work, while HID mode simulates keyboard input that can disrupt typing or active applications
- When you need raw text data instead of keyboard input simulation
- For integration with custom applications that read from COM ports
- When HID mode doesn't work due to compatibility issues
- **Professional barcode scanner replacement:** Many commercial barcode scanners use COM port mode to avoid interrupting the user's workflow

### Setting up RFCOMM mode

1. **Enable RFCOMM mode:**
   - Open the app settings
   - Change "Connection Mode" from "HID Keyboard" to "RFCOMM (SPP)"

2. **Pair your devices:**
   - Unpair your phone from PC (both sides) if previously connected
   - Remove phone from PC Bluetooth device list
   - In the app, search for devices and connect to your PC
   - Confirm pairing on both devices

3. **Verify COM port creation:**
   - On Windows: Go to Device Manager â†’ Ports (COM & LPT)
   - You should see "Standard Serial over Bluetooth link" with a COM port number
   - If not visible, try unpairing and re-pairing using the app

4. **Receiving data on PC:**
   - **Option A:** Use terminal software (PuTTY, RealTerm, Arduino IDE Serial Monitor)
   - **Option B:** Write custom software to read from the COM port
   - **Option C:** Use PowerShell: `[System.IO.Ports.SerialPort]::GetPortNames()` to list ports

### Troubleshooting RFCOMM

**No COM port appears:**
- Unpair devices completely and re-pair using the app (not Windows settings)
- Ensure "RFCOMM (SPP)" mode is selected before pairing
- **Manual COM port management:** If automatic port creation fails:
  1. Go to Windows Bluetooth settings â†’ More Bluetooth options â†’ COM Ports tab
  2. Click "Add" â†’ Select "Outgoing" port type
  3. Choose your phone from device list â†’ Select "Barcode Scanner" service
  4. Click OK to create the COM port

**Can't read data from COM port:**
- Verify the correct COM port number in Device Manager
- Check if another application is already using the port
- For Bluetooth SPP, baud rate setting is usually ignored, but some software may require any value

**Technical details:**
- **Protocol:** Bluetooth SPP (Serial Port Profile)
- **UUID:** `00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`
- **Data encoding:** UTF-8
- **Connection:** Bidirectional (app can send and receive data)
- **Baud rate:** Not applicable (Bluetooth protocol handles data transfer)

**For developers:**
Sample Python code to read from RFCOMM:
```python
import serial
port = serial.Serial('COM3')  # Baud rate not needed for Bluetooth SPP
while True:
    data = port.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
    print(f"Received: {data}")
```

Sample C# code using System.IO.Ports:
```csharp
using System.IO.Ports;

SerialPort port = new SerialPort("COM3");
port.Open();
while (true) {
    string data = port.ReadLine();
    Console.WriteLine($"Received: {data}");
}
```

**Recommended for C# developers:** [InTheHand.Net.Bluetooth](https://github.com/inthehand/32feet) library provides better Bluetooth support that allows You more robust connection handling compared to System.IO.Ports.

**Custom RFCOMM implementations:** If you need to adapt the RFCOMM data transmission to simulate specific physical COM scanner behavior (custom protocols, special formatting, etc.), we're open to implementing these features. Please open an issue describing your use case.
